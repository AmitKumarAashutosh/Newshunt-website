		<h1 class="read-h">Stock Market Hit By Coronavirus</h1>
		<p class="read-p">
			In just weeks, the Coronavirus pandemic has shaved off nearly a third of the global market cap. The Indian equity market bounced back valiantly on Friday, but the Sensex still closed 20% below the peak achieved two months ago. Investors can get some cold comfort that other markets have fallen more. The spread of the virus has triggered panic across the world and shaken the confidence of investors.

			As of 12 March, only 29% of the active cases were in China and the remaining 71% were in other parts of the world. Active cases mean the infected people who are still being treated and not yet recovered. While the situation is improving in China, Covid-19 is leading to lockdowns in countries like Italy, South Korea and Iran. Due to spiralling numbers, the US and many countries in Europe are staring at a grim situation. German Chancellor Angela Merkel estimates that “up to 70% of the country’s.
			“Though there will be counter cyclical rallies during times of central bankers’ actions like rate cuts, the outlook is clearly bearish and in worst case, Brent oil can go down to $25 level,” says Praveen Singh, AVP, Fundamental Research – Commodities & Currencies, Sharekhan Comtrade. However, the crude oil war is a blessing in disguise for oil importing economies like India.

			But the fact that the Indian market is out of the overvaluation zone should provide comfort to long-term investors. The broader market valuation has gone below its 10-year average while the 10-year real return from the Sensex is in the negative. In other words, this turmoil is an opportunity for long-term investors. “If you are a longterm investor with a 5-7 year view, this is a fantastic time to start investing. However, the market could fall another 8-10% in between,” says Jimeet Modi, CEO, Samco Securities. Jaspreet Singh Arora, CIO, Equentis Wealth Advisory Servies concurs with this view. “New investors should park around 50% of their equity allocation in the next two weeks and the balance slowly in a staggered manner,” he says.
			The world has suddenly become a different place in the last two months, with Coronavirus or Covid-19 taking a host of nations by storm.

It all started with China, and for some time the rest of the world was looking at China, the most populous nation of the world, with curiosity, at what had suddenly erupted within the region. While China was battling with the fast-spreading virus and the Chinese markets started tanking, other markets (including India) initially distanced themselves from the problem, considering it topical and restricted to China and a few other Asian countries.

Markets in the US, as well as India, were quite resilient for some time. Corporate India seemed to be quick to draw conclusions about how some Indian companies and sectors could benefit from trade and manufacturing orders potentially shifting out of China to other countries, including some to India. Little did anyone anticipate that in a few weeks our country too would need to contend with the virus.

The scenario changed, however, when, totally unanticipated, the virus engulfed the world and WHO declared the Covid-19 as a pandemic, followed by various countries issuing travel bans, emergencies, lockdowns, and other restrictions. Capital markets across the world tanked miserably.

The market fall has been a financial tsunami that has washed away faith and stability in spite of a slew of liquidity injection measures announced by central banks across the world.

The speed with which markets nosedived shook the earth, this intensity has never been witnessed by market participants in the last 3 decades or so. Some likened the current crash to that of 1987, when many young traders who are currently thronging their screens in despair and frustration were not even born.
In the current situation, the stock market fall, in the global markets and India, is mainly on account of Fear of the Unknown. How much can the situation aggravate, how effectively will countries respond in containing the pandemic, in how much time, and the extent of debilitating effect this entire situation will have on economic activity, trade, and demand.

Some cracks are already visible in growth slowdown due to large-scale travel restrictions, the commencement of lock-downs in multiple countries and a curtailment of outdoor activity.

The market fall this time around has not been driven by any actual financial crisis or economic event. Yes, true that for some time the US markets (and even Indian markets) have been hitting new highs, despite expectations of global growth slowing down, and in India's case, economic growth as well as earnings growth being in a prolonged lull phase.

While earnings growth in the US has been on a high all this while, thereby supporting the case for an extended bull market, in India however, unlike in some of the previous cycles, the earnings cycle has been in a bottoming-out phase and not in a peak-out phase.

This brings us to believe that Indian markets should respond favourably once the dust settles, the fear and the panic subsides and human and economic activities are restored.

All relevant authorities (global governments and central banks) are aware of the necessary measures they need to take. The duration of the shock should be limited and followed by a sharp recovery in H2CY20, which will be mainly driven by pent-up demand. The current sell-off should be viewed as a buying opportunity.

What has complicated the global scenario is that amid the virus fear and panic, an oil war has broken out amongst oil majors, with talks breaking off between Russia and the OPEC, and Saudi Arabia swiftly dropping oil prices and announcing an increase in production, with the intention to throw US shale companies out of gear.
